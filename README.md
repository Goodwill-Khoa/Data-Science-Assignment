# Data Science Practical Assignment for MSc Students

## Project Overview
This project provides MSc students with a hands-on experience in data science through practical assignments, focusing on multi-class classification tasks using the MachineLearningCVE dataset.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on high-dimensional network data.
- Engineer features and prepare data for machine learning.
- Implement multi-class classification using several ML algorithms.
- Apply Monte-Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV).
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).
- Compare models using suitable evaluation metrics.
- Present results professionally with plots and tables.

## Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: Load and inspect the MachineLearningCVE dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to discover trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Clean, scale, select, and reduce features.
4. **Model Comparison**: Train and evaluate multiple classifiers.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Use MCCV to assess model stability.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models for the best performance.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and learning outcomes.
